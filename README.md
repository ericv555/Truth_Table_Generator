I made this program to assist in the creation in logical truth tables for propositonal logic. I suspect it may also be useful for checking the boolean output of logic gates in circuit design.
To run this program download the folder and run the executable titled proof_checker.
The logical connectives I included are, ~ (negation) this is a unary connective that negates the value of whatever is to the right of it. ex) ~(p->q), ~p->q.
All of the following connectives are binary.
& (conjunction,AND), -> (conditonal,IF THEN), <-> (Biconditonal, If and Only If), v (disjunction, OR).
The scope of a binary connective in a sentence with more than two propositonal characters is determined by parantheses. As such parantheses are required for such sentences.
EX) (p->q)&r
~(p->q)&r
(PvQ)&(t->x)
((p->q)&s)vt
